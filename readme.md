PyTGM
====
Fangame of TGM series, powered by Python3 and PySDL2

## Dependency

- Python 3.5 (Tested only in 3.5 version. Further testing needed.)
- PySDL2 0.9.5
- libsdl2(with libsdl2-image, libsdl2-mixer, libsdl2-ttf)

## How to Play

Keybind change is not available ingame. You have to edit module/ctrl.py for it.  
- A/D for shift left/right
- W for Sonic Drop
- S for lock piece on ground. ("drop faster" function is bugged, and will be fixed)
- J/L for rotate CCW/CW
- I for hold piece

Title screen and Menu is not implemented, so when you execute, game instantly starts.
